<h3>Content Encryption</h3>
<p>You must define an encryption key to encrypt your library content. Provide your own key or generate a new one. Each time that you configure a new key, you must download a file that contains the key before you save the configuration and enable encryption. Protecting and managing the encryption key is your responsibility.</p>
