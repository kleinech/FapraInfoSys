# Goals
* Overall goal is to create an ECM portal for companies that do not
  want to host their data with one of the big providers.
* IBM's commercial portal can be used as a model for orientation
* All the components should be developed using only free open source
  licences
* The specific goals of this work group include:
  * set up a web application and create design that can easily be
	extended whenever more functionality is to be added
  * Specificly focus on the design and implementation of security
	aspects, namely the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Access
	Control)
  * this aspect of the portal must offer functions to manage users,
	groups and roles.
* The design must be appealing as it is presented to the user for
  direct interation
* The design and implementation must be easy to understand and easy to
  operate in order to deliver a pleasent user experience. This is one
  of the important reasons why customers choose one provider over
  another.
